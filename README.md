# Prime Fold Theory — Research Modules

**Author:** Sean Sowden

Prime Fold Theory (PFT) is a structural ontology for physics that builds the
universe from an information-zero baseline, rather than assuming spacetime,
fields, or energy.

The hierarchy is:

- **0D — Prime Substrate**  
  Information-zero, no geometry, no time, no energy, no fields, no metrics.

- **1D — Prime Fold**  
  The first informational event (“power-on”), creating the arrow of time and
  activating three primitives:
  - Fold-Time **τ̄** — tension-like accumulation with reset at collapse,  
  - Fold-Density **Φ** — informational/structural loading,  
  - Threshold **κ** — local collapse bound.

- **2D — Fold Field**  
  A discrete relational surface where geometry emerges as a *behavior* of the
  network (adjacency, distance, curvature-like patterns), not as a substance.

- **3D — Shells and Skew (Gravity)**  
  3D volume appears when regions of the Fold Field wrap or layer into shells.
  Imperfect layering produces **skew** — a structural imbalance that radiates
  outward with a natural \(1/r^2\) pattern. Gravity is interpreted as skew from
  shells, rather than curvature of a fundamental spacetime.

The traditional law-of-invariance program (Φτ̄ conservation between events with
threshold resets) is preserved and developed in later modules, but now sits on
top of this deeper ontological ladder.

## 📖 Modules

### [Module 1 — The Prime Substrate (2025 Ontology Rewrite)](module1/Module1.pdf)

**Status:** Current canonical foundation (see `module1/`).  

Defines:

- the Prime Substrate (0D, information-zero),
- the Prime Fold as the unique first event (1D),
- the Fold Field as the first geometric layer (2D),
- shells and skew as the origin of 3D volume and gravity.

Goals:

- Show that geometry is **emergent**, not assumed.  
- Show that curvature is **optional**; skew from shells is sufficient for
  gravitational behavior.  
- Place GR and QM as effective descriptions on top of the Fold hierarchy
  (rather than competing foundations).

**Type:** Ontology-first, theory foundation.

### Module 2.1 — Cross-System Simulation

**Status:** Simulation study (see `module2.1/` or `paper/` subtree if legacy).  

Stress-tests Fold-Time invariance and threshold dynamics across multiple toy
systems (e.g. SRF-like lattices, quake toys), dimensions, and parameter sweeps.

Key results:

- Normalized Fold-Time cycles (τ̄ with reset at κ) show structural invariance
  across different systems and conditions.
- Supports the idea that the Φ–τ̄–κ primitives behave consistently across
  heterogeneous substrates once mapped into the Fold framework.

**Type:** Simulation / numerical experiment.

### Module 2.2 — Mathematical Well-Posedness

**Status:** Math foundation module (see `module2.2/` or `paper/`).  

Establishes a rigorous backbone for Fold dynamics via the “Big Five” theorems:

1. Positivity  
2. Existence & Uniqueness  
3. Budget Closure  
4. Reset Locality  
5. Anti-Zeno

Includes:

- a minimal reference solver (`fold_solver_1d.py`),
- plotting / demo scripts,
- notes on verification and audit structure.

**Type:** Mathematical foundation and reference implementation.

### Module 5 — Quaoar: First Observable Fold-Shell Anomaly

**Status:** Empirical application (see `paper/` subtree).  

Applies Fold gravity / shell-skew interpretation to Quaoar’s ring system beyond
the Roche limit.

Results:

- The ring location matches a predicted Fold-shell boundary rather than a
  classical Roche limit constraint.
- Extension of the same reasoning to Haumea and Chariklo suggests a wider class
  of ring–shell anomalies.

**Type:** Observational test / case study.

---

### Legacy / SRF-Era Drafts

Earlier drafts and SRF-centric formulations (e.g. the original Module 1 focused
on the “Structural Recursive Field”) are preserved under the `paper/` directory
for historical and comparison purposes. These represent the 2024-era framing
prior to the Prime Substrate / Prime Fold / Fold Field ontology rewrite.
