# Prime Fold Theory

**Module IV: QUAOAR.01 — Testing Recursive Boundaries**  
A structural reinterpretation of planetary ring formation using fold tension and recursive collapse mechanics.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the source files, figures, and documentation for **Module IV** of the Prime Fold theoretical framework.

The paper presents a fold-based explanation for the stability of Quaoar’s ring system — a phenomenon that violates the classical Roche limit. This empirical success supports the broader Prime Fold model as a viable mechanism for recursive collapse and structural emergence in physical systems.
