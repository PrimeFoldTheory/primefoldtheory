# Module 1: The Prime Substrate

This folder contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for **Module 1** of Prime Fold Theory.

Module 1 is the ontological foundation of the entire framework. It does **not** assume
spacetime, fields, or energy. Instead, it builds the universe from a sequence of
minimal structural steps:

1. **0D — Prime Substrate**  
   - Information-zero, no geometry, no time, no energy, no fields, no metrics.  
   - Pure “noun” with no verbs: nothing acts, nothing changes.

2. **1D — Prime Fold**  
   - The first informational event: the first distinction (“this vs not-this”).  
   - Creates the arrow of time and introduces the primitive Fold quantities:
     - Fold-Time `\bar{\tau}` (tension-like accumulation),
     - Fold-Density `\Phi` (informational content),
     - Threshold `\kappa` (collapse condition).

3. **2D — Fold Field**  
   - A discrete 2D evaluation network of nodes and adjacency links.  
   - Geometry emerges as a **relational behavior** of this network  
     (distance = minimal path, neighborhoods, boundaries, curvature-like effects, etc.).

4. **3D — Shells and Skew (Gravity)**  
   - 3D volume appears when regions of the Fold Field wrap or layer into shells.  
   - Imperfect layering produces **skew** — a structural imbalance that radiates outward
     with a natural \(1/r^2\) pattern.  
   - Gravity is reinterpreted as skew from shells, not curvature of a fundamental spacetime.

## Key Claims of Module 1

- Geometry is **emergent**, not fundamental.  
- The universe starts from an information-zero state.  
- The **Prime Fold** is the first and only “power-on” event.  
- The **Fold Field** replaces classical “spacetime” as the first geometric layer.  
- **Skew** (from layered shells) is sufficient to account for gravitational behavior,  
  making curvature optional rather than primitive.  
- GR and QM are re-framed as **effective descriptions** of different layers of the Fold
  hierarchy, not rival foundations.
